## ✨ What Are Chakras?

In the ancient spiritual traditions of **India**, chakras are considered **energy centers** located along the spine that govern different physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of life.  
The term *“chakra”* (चक्र) means *“wheel”* or *“disk”* in Sanskrit — symbolizing rotating energy vortices that keep our body, mind, and spirit aligned.  

Balancing these chakras through meditation, yoga, and sound therapy helps harmonize your inner self and connect with the universe’s divine flow.
